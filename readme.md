# üõ†Ô∏è 50-Day System Design Learning Plan

**Goal**: Learn high-level system design by building real-world scalable applications.

**Note** I'm creating this repo for learning how to write technical things, improve my consistency in learning, and to help someone in case they try to learn SD! Currently the plan is for 50 days these problems, but I might keep adding more things over here if I'll enjoy this series
